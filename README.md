# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on a set of numeric and categorical variables. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis and machine learning models are developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various features, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed using the following link:  
[Diabetes Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quangnguynl/diabetes-prediction/notebook#Numeric-Variable)

The dataset contains several medical variables that may have a significant influence on the likelihood of developing diabetes. It includes the following columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies the patient has had.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function, which is a measure of diabetes in family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Whether the patient is diabetic (1) or not (0).
